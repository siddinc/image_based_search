# Image based Search
Content-based Image Retrieval (CBIR) is used to searching a database for images that match a query image. This project uses a Convolutional Autoencoder to form latent image embeddings of various images in the CIFAR10 dataset. A data structure called Vantage Point Tree is used for indexing and retrieving the embeddings in O(n * log n) and O(log n) time respectively.
